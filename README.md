# Natural Language Generator Demo

This project as a minimal example of [Natural Language Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for the [Derivator project](https://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/derivator/).

It is based on the book [Building Natural Language Generation Systems](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/building-natural-language-generation-systems/0AE70C709A9BFBDC80B349B2D22A78CD).

Limitations:

* Only first order logic expressions can be compiled in natural language.
