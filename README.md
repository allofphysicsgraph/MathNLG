# Natural Language Generator Demo

This project as a minimal example of [Natural Language Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation) for the [Derivator project](https://allofphysicsgraph.github.io/derivator/).

Programming part is based on the book [Building Natural Language Generation Systems](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/building-natural-language-generation-systems/0AE70C709A9BFBDC80B349B2D22A78CD). Writing style is based on [Handbook for Spoken Mathematics: Larryâ€™s Speakeasy](http://englishlangkan.com/produk/E%20Book%20Handbook%20for%20Spoken%20Mathematics.pdf) from 1983.

## Goal

Create a re-usable, semantically meaningful way of storing knowledge. Start a truly collaborative platform for high quality scientific writing. Implement surface realizers for as many languages as possible, especially very exotic once, to ensure everyone has access to high quality study materials.

## How to

Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Limitations

* Only first order logic expressions can be compiled in natural language.
